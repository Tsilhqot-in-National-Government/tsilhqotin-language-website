        Memory Match Tŝilhqot’in
        The Memory Match game is one of Bella’s favourite activities to bring to the schools. That inspired this digital app where you can build your vocabulary as you look for matches. Available for Android and iOS.
        
        Android

        https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memory-match-t%C5%9Dilhqotin/id1462972336?mt=8
        
        The current version features Bella Alphonse’s original 6 rounds (also found on the web version) and an additional 6 rounds completed by Maria Myers. Aaron picked a collection of pictures for Maria to describe that included many common or interesting verbs.
        
        We hope more speakers will contribute additional rounds in the future. This app is a favourite among Tŝilhqot’in children.
        
        Tŝilhqot’in Alphabet
        This app goes along with the modernized Tŝilhqot’in Alphabet Poster. It can be used as a ’cheat sheet’ for the poster.

        Qungh ʔAnaghunt’in
        This is a prototype for an interactive language learning game. We will eventually build a more comprehensive version of this game with newer technology.
        
        Currently available on Android 7.0 + only. We are changing the technology on this one to reach a broader audience.

        This game features ’respond-to-command’ as well as ’word-builder’ interactions. The ’word-builder’ approach encourages learners to focus separately on the stem or prefix as opposed to trying to digest long verbs whole. It was implemented by Aaron Plahn based on his experience with the language acquisition of children Briseis and Dakota, who have been learning from their grandparents Tina and Mary Setah. They mastered the meaning of verb stems quite early, and only began to make sense of the prefixes much later. Some of the things they say are quite comical!
